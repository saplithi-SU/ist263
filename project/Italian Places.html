            <h2>Tarallucci E Vino</h2>
            <p>This restaurant's motto is "all ends well with Tarallucci E Vino." It perfectly represents this fantastic Italian restaurant's experience with numerous locations all around in NYC, including the Upper Westside, Nomad, Union Square, and the East Village.
             This place has been serving real authentic Italian food since 2001. My go-to meal at this place is the burrata and Spaghetti Pomodoro.
