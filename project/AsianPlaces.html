                <h2>Beyond Sushi</h2>
                    <p>Beyond Sushi is a fantastic, entirely vegan sushi place located all around NYC. There are over 6 locations dedicated to providing the best vegan meals to anyone! 
                    Their purpose to give an everlasting impact on both your palette and the planet using plant-based offerings. You can go there and eat, deliver, or even cater to events. My go-to order that I recommend is the Spicy Mang Sushi and the Fun Guy Dumplings. </p>

                <h3>Nom Wah Tea Parlor</h3>
                    <p>My personal favorite place to eat in the city is the Nom Wah Tea Parlor. I have been going there for years with my friends, and I never felt more stuffed/ full in my life. Nom Wah Tea Parlor is easily a staple part of the Asian food culture in the city.
                    This restaurant is dedicated to offering real authentic Chinese cuisine. Although it is difficult to choose my favorite meal, I would recommend getting the house special roast pork bun and dessert the steamed red bean buns.</p>

                <h4>Panna ii Garden Indian Restaurant</h4>
                    <p>If you're looking for a fun and exciting place to eat, then for sure go to Panna II Garden Indian Restaurant. Although this restaurant is popular for its Indian food, it has become more famous for its decor. 
                    The restaurant shines Christmas tree lights all year round! It feels like your legit inside of a Christmas tree!  This restaurant is very accommodating; it offers four different menus, including one that is entirely vegetarian. 
                    I would definitely recommend getting the Paneer Jalfrezi.An important note to add is that this restaurant only accepts cash.</p>
