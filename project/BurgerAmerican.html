                <h2>Five Napkins Burgers</h2>
                    <p>If you ask any New Yorker where it is an excellent place to get burgers, they will surely mention 5 Napkin Burger! 
                    They're located on the Upper West Side, Union Square, Hell's Kitchen, and Upper East Side. No need to fret if you're not crazy about burgers; this restaurant offers salad bowls, soups, and other entrees.
                    But if you do love burgers, they offer over ten various burgers. If you plan to go here, I recommend the five napkin burger, kale shredded salad bowl, appetizer, and tavern onion ring tower.  A bonus is to order the cookies n' cream or s' mores milkshake.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pricing:$$ out of $$$$</strong></p>

                <h3>The Smith</h3>
                    <p>The Smith is definitely a New Yorker favorite amongst the many different American restaurants.  There are numerous Smith locations around the city, but their upbeat energy environment is found everywhere. 
                    The name the Smith means maker, and they are intended to be the maker of creating happiness. I would recommend getting their renowned mac cheese and salmon!</p>

                <h4>Black Tap</h4>
                    <p>The Black Tap is relatively new in the city but definitely became a popular trendy restaurant.
                    It has become famous through its Instagramable food and drinks. Not only are they focused on making the food delicious, but try to make it as artistic appealing as well!
                    For example, their milkshakes are decorated to be as crazy as possible, with even a cake slice on top of the drink. I would recommend getting the mulberry street burger and getting either the cookie n' cream supreme milkshake or the Bam Bam Shake!</p>
